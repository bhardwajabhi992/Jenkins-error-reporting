# Jenkins-error-reporting

**Setting Up the Pipeline**: Think of Jenkins as a manager overseeing tasks. The script starts by telling Jenkins to be ready to run any tasks (agent any).

**Running Tests**: Imagine you have a bunch of tests that need to be run, like checking if a website works correctly. This part of the script tells Jenkins to actually run those tests.

**Checking for Problems**: After the tests finish, we want Jenkins to check if anything went wrong. It does this by looking at the results of the tests. If something didn't work as expected, it remembers that there was a problem.

**Sending a Message to Slack**: Now, if Jenkins finds any problems, it wants to let us know. It does this by sending a message to a Slack channel (like a group chat). The message says something like, "Hey, the tests didn't work! Check Jenkins for details."

**Making it Your Own**: You'll need to tell Jenkins where to send the message by giving it the address of your Slack channel. And if you want the message to say something specific, you can customize it to fit your needs.

So, in simpler terms, this script helps Jenkins run tests, checks if there are any problems, and then sends a message to Slack if something goes wrong.


In order to understand with a daily life example,

What’s a Jenkins Pipeline?
Imagine you’re baking a cake. A Jenkins pipeline is like a recipe for baking that cake. It tells Jenkins (our kitchen helper) what steps to follow to build and test your software.

The Stages: Think of stages as different parts of the recipe. For example:

“Run Tests” is like the step where you mix ingredients and put the cake in the oven.
Inside this stage, you’d run your software tests (like checking if the cake is baked properly).
What Happens When Things Go Wrong?

Sometimes the cake doesn’t turn out perfect. Similarly, in software, things can fail (tests might not pass).
Our recipe has a special section called “post” that handles failures.
If the tests fail (like a burnt cake), we want to notify someone.

Sending a Slack Message:
Imagine you have a magic messenger bird (let’s call it Slack Bird).
When the cake burns, the Slack Bird flies to your team’s Slack channel and says, “Hey, the cake failed!”
In our script, we use the slackSend command to send this message to Slack.


### Alternative approach ###
Rather than using the simple groovy code, you can achieve the same task with the help of shell scripting or optimizing the individual build steps with the pipeline.
